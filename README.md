IoTRoutes is an IoT platform designed to efficiently manage and route messages in connected object environments. 
It offers a robust and scalable solution for processing the large amounts of data generated by devices. In addition to communication, the platform ensures message analysis and interpretation using configurable interpreters.
The platform is built on a set of pillars offering flexibility and power, including:
  - IoT message templates in multiple formats, configurable and optimized for the devices to be managed.
  - Visual workflows to configure message routing, conversion, and classification.
  - Valuable interpreters for message analysis, interpretation, and classification.
  - Configurable message lifecycle for efficient message tracking and classification.
  - Command board simplifies device control.
  - Scheduled jobs allow for deferred processing such as interfacing with other systems or generating statistics and reports.
